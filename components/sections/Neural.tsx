 * The section is built around the star, and leaves through it. The star
 * grows the whole way down; over the last quarter of the pin it opens
 * past the corners of the screen and the work section — already pinned
 * underneath — is what you see through the shape.
 *
 * The star figure is a sibling of the panel, not a child, because the
 * panel is what gets masked: a child would be cut by the same hole it is
 * meant to be drawing the edge of.
