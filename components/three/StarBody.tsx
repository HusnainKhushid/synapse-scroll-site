/**
 * The chrome star in the closing panel. Metal, so there is no diffuse
 * term at all — everything visible is the analytic environment reflected
 * off the body, tinted by the violet ground it sits on.
 *
 * Ambient tiers stay very dark and the emitters run hot (100x and up).
 * That ratio is what makes it read as polished metal; lifting the ambient
 * to "brighten it" is what turns it into grey plastic.
