 * One mutable object shared between the scroll layer and the render loop.

 * and routing that through `useState` re-renders the tree at 60 Hz.
 *
 * Sections here are not uniform in height (a pinned reel needs more scroll
 * than a parallax gallery), so instead of one global `raw` in section units
 * each stage measures itself and publishes two numbers:
 *
 *   pin    0..1  progress through the stage's own pin window
 *   travel 0..1  progress across the viewport, from "top edge enters" to
 *                "bottom edge leaves" — the one parallax should read
